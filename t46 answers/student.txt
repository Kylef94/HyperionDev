1) create table

CREATE TABLE Student(
STU_NUM CHAR(6),
STU_SNAME VARCHAR(15),
STU_FNAME VARCHAR(15),
STU_INITIAL CHAR(1),
STU_STARTDATE DATE,
COURSE_CODE CHAR(3),
PROJ_NUM INT(2))


2) add rows to table

INSERT INTO Student
	VALUES ('01', 'Snow', 'John', 'E', '2014-04-01', '201', 06);

INSERT INTO Student
	VALUES ('02', 'Stark', 'Arya', 'C', '2017-07-12','305', 11);

3) list attributed for course 305

SELECT * FROM Student
WHERE COURSE_CODE = 305;

4) change course code to 304 for student num 7 

UPDATE Student
SET COURSE_CODE = 304
WHERE STU_NUM = "07";

5) delete jaime lannister

DELETE FROM Student
WHERE STU_SNAME = "Lannister" AND STU_FNAME = 'Jaime' AND STU_STARTDATE = '05-Sep-12' AND COURSE_CODE = '101' AND PROJ_NUM = 2;

6) change proj num to 14 for students who started after 01 jan 16 and course code at least 201

UPDATE Student
SET PROJ_NUM = 14
WHERE STU_STARTDATE < '01-Jan-16' AND COURSE_CODE > '201';


7) delete all rows from table but keep table

****NOTE: EXAMPLE IN PDF SAYS COMMAND SHOULD BE "DELETE * FROM Student;" BUT THIS IS INCORRECT, see https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_delete.asp   ******

DELETE FROM Student;

8) delete student table entirely

DROP TABLE Student;
