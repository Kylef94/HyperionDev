1) What is normalizaton

Normalization is the process of evaluating table sturctures in a database to minimize redundancies and
therefore improve performance and avoid data anomalies.



2) When is a table in 1NF?

A table is said to be in 1NF if all iof its key attributes are clearly defined, none of the groups in the table repeat,
and any attributes are dependent on the tables primary key



3) When is a table in 2NF?

A table is in 2NF when it meets the requirements for 1NF, and does not include any partial dependencies(i.e attributed dependent on only part of the primary key)



4) When is a table in 3NF?

When a table meets the requirements for 2NF, while also not containing any transitive dependencies.



5) draw dependency diagram for INVOICE table

INV_NUM, PROD_NUM -> SALE_DATE, QUANT_SOLD, PROD_LABEL, PROD_PRICE, VEND_CODE, VEND_NAME


INV_NUM -> SALE_DATE, QUANT_SOLD, VEND_CODE, VEND_NAME

PROD_NUM -> PROD_LABEL, PROD_PRICE

VEND_CODE -> VEND_NAME



5) Remove all partial dependencies, draw the new dep. diagrams, and identify the NF for each table created
INV_NUM 
PROD_NUM
INV_NUM PROD_NUM

INVOICE(INV_NUM, SALE_DATE, VEND_CODE, VEND_NAME) (2NF)
PRODUCT(PROD_NUM, PROD_LABEL, PROD_PRICE) (3NF)
SALES(INV_NUM, PROD_NUM, QUANT_SOLD) (3NF)




6) Remove all transitive dependencies, draw the new dep. diagrams, and identify the NF for each table created


INVOICE(INV_NUM, SALE_DATE, VEND_CODE) (3NF)
VENDORS(VEND_CODE, VEND_NAME) (3NF)
PRODUCT(PROD_NUM, PROD_LABEL, PROD_PRICE) (3NF)
SALES(INV_NUM, PROD_NUM, QUANT_SOLD) (3NF)
